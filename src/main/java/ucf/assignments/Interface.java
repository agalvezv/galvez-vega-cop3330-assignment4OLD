    //this area will keep track of the gui interface
    //and will be location that holds variables, specifically list variables
    //(single lists to lists of lists) that move between list management and list mov operations.

    //one function will represent making a new object that represent a new list
    //this function will make use of the listmanagement function

    //one function will represent the button that allows to add new items to the list

    //one function will represent the button that allows to store single+ list
    //this function will use a loop to check how many lists will be checked
    //single and multiple read to external storage will use same function
    //List Move Operations class will be called with this list
    //appropriate text file will be created

    //one function will represent the button that allows to receive single+ list
    //single and multiple read to external storage will use same function
    //this will all go into the same list
    //List Move Operations class will be called with this list
    //will draw from the appropriate text file
    //asking for the name of the text file will come from this side
    //scan in a new with a string variable,
    //this will be sent to list move operations when the function is called
