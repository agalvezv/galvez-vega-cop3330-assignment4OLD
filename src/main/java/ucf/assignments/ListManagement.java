    //replace old variable with new variable


    //function for  list completion
    //bool in the array list is set to false if the item is incomplete
    //use a loop to check for a specific match
    //as things will be organize it might be possible to use a binary search
    //if match found set item on array list to true
    //adjust other array lists according with loop method

    //function to print completed parts of list
    //loop to print out completed items with the bool paramater as a check
